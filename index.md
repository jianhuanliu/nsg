Near-surface Seismic Imaging Tools
==================================

Codes developed during my PhD and have the main application at archaeological sites.
--------------------------------------------------

This site host a series of codes I developed during my Ph.D. I think it is good for me to document those work and make it avaliable to others. These inclues:

- Surface-wave retrieve by Seismic Interferomrtry;
- Surface-wave suppression by non-stationary adaptive subtraction;
- Diffraction imaging by multi-path summation;
- Partical Swarm Optimisation;
- Common-reflection Stacking (CRS) for reflection imaging;
- [Decompress vibrator seismic data and set geometry](man1/man1_st01.md)

I also present all the scripts that I used to prepare the following papers:
- [Near-surface diffractor detection  based on an interferometric workflow](ch3/ch3_main.md)
- [Characterization of near-surface structures by Love-wave inversions (raw version)](ch5/ch5_main.md)
